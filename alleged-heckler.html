      <p>The young man accused of throwing coins and yelling "F*** the Jews" at Dave Portnoy outside a Mississippi pizza shop has been charged in the high-profile case ... TMZ has learned.</p>
      <p>Brandon Lovelady -- Public Information Officer for the Starkville Police Department -- tells TMZ ... officers arrested 20-year-old Patrick McClintock on Monday and charged him with disturbing the peace.</p>
      <p>On Friday, cops became aware of the viral video showing the altercation and they issued an arrest warrant for McClintock, according to Lovelady.</p>
      <p>McClintock posed for a mug shot ... staring blankly into the camera while wearing a buttoned-down shirt. Police say he was processed and released.</p>
      <p>As for the alleged crime, Lovelady tells us ... "Every person has the right to feel safe and respected in our community. Offensive words alone are protected, but when behavior disrupts a public event or risks violence, the Starkville Police Department will take steps to help maintain safety and security."</p>
      <p>He goes on to say ... "The State of Mississippi allows courts to impose enhanced penalties if a violation meets the criteria for bias-motivated or discriminatory reasons. This remains under investigation."</p>
      <p>Portnoy and his Barstool crew were in town ahead of the Mississippi State vs Univ. of Georgia football game -- and he was filming one of his "One Bite" pizza reviews when the incident went down.</p>
      <p>Just yesterday ... the Barstool founder appeared on "CBS Sunday Morning" saying he's experiencing daily antisemitism.</p>
