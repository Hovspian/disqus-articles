      <p>Pete Buttigieg joined the Democratic dissent over Sunday night’s Senate deal to reopen the government without any assurances about the future of health care.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg, who served as transportation secretary during the Biden administration, posted to X on Monday, “It’s a bad deal.”</p>
      <p>Buttigieg continued, “Everyday life – making it better and more affordable – must always be our bottom line. For months, I’ve been hearing from people bracing for their health insurance bills to skyrocket – so much that some will lose coverage altogether. Some say they simply haven’t even opened their letter yet, dreading the bad news. Any deal that fails to address this directly is a bad deal.”</p>
      <p>The Democratic senators who voted for the CR on Sunday night were: Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), Sen. Angus King (I-ME), Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH), and Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA)</p>
      <p>Some prominent Democrats have spoken out against the deal, with California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) calling it “pathetic” and declaring, “Americans deserve better.”</p>
      <p>Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut (D-CN) claimed, “There’s no way to defend this,” and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) predicted, “It would be a policy and political disaster for the Democrats to cave.”</p>
      <p>Some Democrats, like Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s lack of leadership for the situation and called for his ouster.</p>
