      <p>Paramount Skydance’s $108 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery includes billions of dollars in funding from Middle East investors and Jared Kushner’s private equity firm, according to reports on Monday.</p>
      <p>Those details emerged soon after Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison announced his company was mounting a challenge to Netflix’s WBD bid, which he called an “inferior” offer.</p>
      <p>“A filing confirms that Paramount’s tender offer is also supported by $24 billion in debt financing from sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Abu Dhabi, as well as from Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners,” The Hollywood Reporter reported.</p>
      <p>Axios noted “Affinity Partners was not mentioned in Paramount’s press release on Monday morning about its $108 billion bid, nor were participating sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar.”</p>
      <p>Paramount’s tender offer is for $30 per share, which would all be paid in cash, compared to Netflix’s $27.75 offer, which is a mix of cash and stock. Netflix’s offer is worth about $83 billion.</p>
      <p>Ellison and his investors are offering more for WBD while also aiming to acquire more — as THR reported, Netflix is “only buying WBD’s streaming and studios business, while Paramount is pursuing the whole company.” WBD owns the HBO Max and Discovery+ streaming services, as well as famous franchises like Harry Potter, Looney Tunes, and DC Comics.</p>
      <p>Kushner’s inclusion in Paramount Skydance’s offer comes after Netflix boss Ted Sarandos recently met with his father-in-law, President Donald Trump, according to The New York Post and Bloomberg; Sarandos was making his case for why Netflix acquiring WBD would not be an antitrust violation.</p>
      <p>Trump on Sunday praised Sarandos as a shrewd businessman, but also said Netflix’s bid for WBD “could be a problem.”</p>
      <p>David Ellison’s father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is also a big supporter of President Trump.</p>
      <p>Axios reported that, as part of Paramount’s tender offer, its foreign investors “have agreed to forgo any governance rights – including board representation – associated with their non-voting equity investments.”</p>
      <p>The bidding war has been good for WBD shareholders, obviously. WBD’s stock price was up 5.50% in early trading on Monday, hitting $27.51 per share; its share price is up 158% since the start of the year.</p>
